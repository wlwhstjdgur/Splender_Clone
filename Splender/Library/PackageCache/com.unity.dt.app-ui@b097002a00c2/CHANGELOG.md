### Removed

- Removed `Unity.AppUI.Core.AppUI.DismissAnyPopups` method. Popups are now registered per `Panel` element.
- Removed `Canvas.scrollDirection` property in order to support correctly the scroll direction set in the Operating System's preferences.
- Removed programatic construction of RadioGroup with IList object. Since App UI offers the possibility to have Radio component as deep as you want in the visual tree compared to its RadioGroup ancestor, we wanted to limit conflicts between construction kinds.

- Removed the Popup message Handler that was used to dispatch the display or dismissal of Popups. While this removes thread safety, it fixes issues with ordering of events to dismiss popups.

### Changed

- Refactored SliderBase and BaseSlider for performance improvements and better features. The RangeSliderBase class has been removed and RangeSliderFloat/RangeSliderInt are now derived from SliderBase directly.
- The `Platform`, `AppUIInput` and `GestureRecognizer` classes now use pre-allocated buffers to deal with Touch events in a single frame, and expects a `ReadOnlySpan<AppUITouch>` type to work with instead of `AppUITouch[]`.
- Refactored switch statement builder for Redux slice construction.
- The `NavDestination` node now uses a `NavDestinationTemplate` as a delegate to create and set up a `INavigationScreen` when reaching this destination.
- Subscribing to a Redux Store returns a `IDisposableSubscription` object instead of a method. You can dispose it by calling its `Dispose` method.
- Changed DialogTrigger.keyboardDismissDisabled to DialogTrigger.keyboardDismissEnabled for consistency.
- Make Host optional when intializing an `App` implementation.
- Renamed `IUIToolkitApp.mainPage` property into `IUIToolkitApp.rootVisualElement` for more clarity.
- Moved `NavDestination` specific settings such as `showAppBar` inside the new `DefaultNavDestinationTemplate`.
- Replaced ClickEvent action in MenuItem builder by an EventBase action
- Refactored completely the DropZone UI element. Now the DropZone doesn't embed any logic, but uses a `DropZoneController` instead. You can access this controller via `DropZone.controller` property and attaches a callback method to accept dragged objects and listens to drop events.
- Changed `ticks` related properties in Slider components with a new `marks` property. To configure marks you can you the new `step` property or directly set your `customMarks`
- Changed StoryBookEnumProperty class to become a generic type. You need to specify the Enum type as typedef parameter.
- Refactored Redux API fore more flexibility. See the migration guide in the package documentation.
- Renamed Popup.parentView to Popup.containerView for more clarity.
- Complete rewrite of the SplitView component. The SplitView is no more a derived from TwoPaneSplitView from UI-Toolkit, but a full custom component that supports any number of panes.
- Scrollable manipulator now stops the propagation of WheelEvent. This affects only the Drawer and SwipeView elements.
- Defer checking Popup's container candidate when the Popup is about to be shown, instead of during Popup creation.
- Use `resolvedStyle.translate` instead of `transform.position` to move elements such as the `Canvas` container.
- Changed DropZoneController to support any VisualElement as target instead of a DropZone element.
- Changed the Text element inside the ColorField to become a selectable text.
- Others assembly modules such as `Redux`, `MVVM` and `Navigation` has been configured to be auto-referenced in the Unity project's assemblies.
- Refactored every native plugin provided by the package.

- Refactored the styling of Chip UI element.
- Moved Toast animation logic from code to USS.
- Changed the Trackpad sample project to work properly with the new events coming from the new Gesture Recognizer System.
- Refactored the SwipeView element logic, without impacting the public API.
- The `RadioGroup` component uses a `string` type for its `value` property. This string value is equal to the currently checked `Radio` component's `key` property.
- The `Toast.AddAction` method will now ask for a callback that takes a `Toast` object as argument (instead of no argument at all). This will give you an easier way to dismiss the toast from the action callback.
- You can now pass an `autoDismiss` argument to the `Toast.AddAction` method. This will automatically dismiss the toast when the action is triggered. This argument is optional and defaults to `true` for backward compatibility.
- Rewrite of App UI shaders in pure `HLSL` instead of legacy `CG` language.
- Changed MemoryUtils.Concatenate implementation to not use variadic parameters and avoid implicit allocations.
- Replaced the MacOS native plugin by a `.dylib` library instead of a `.bundle` one.
- App UI shaders are now optionally embedded in Player builds. You can change this setting in your main App UI settings instance. The default value is `true`.
- Storybook stories are now sorted alphabetically.
- Upgraded the old Drag And Drop Sample to use the refactored DropZone and the new Drag And Drop system.
- Renamed `Create/App UI/Settings` menu item into `Create/App UI/App UI Settings`
- Changed the way MarkDirtyRepaint is scheduled on elements containing animated textures (check properly for visibility).
- Replaced the dropdown with an ObjectField to pick an available App UI settings asset.
- The Canvas now uses `Experimental.Animation` system from UI-Toolkit for its damping effect when releasing the mouse with some velocity. That replaces the previous implementation that was using the `VisualElementScheduledItem`.
- Changed fade in animation in Tooltip to use USS transitions.
- Changed the styling of primary action buttons in AlertDialog UI element.
- Changed the Context API to propagate contexts over _internal_ components hierarchies and not just the high-level hierarchy (via `contentContainer`).
- Refactored the `FindResponderInChain` native method in MacOS platform to avoid undefined behaviours.
- Refactored the styling of DropZone UI element.
- `CircularProgress` and `LinearProgress` elements with `Indeterminate` variant won't be marked as `DirtyRepaint` if they are off-screen anymore.

- Added the support of App UI settings asset file from packages. If there's no persistent App UI settings asset defined for your project, App UI Manager will try to find one not only in the Project assets but also in Packages. You can always switch between settings via the **Project Settings > App UI** settings pane.
- Added `Unity.AppUI.UI.Chip.deletedWithEventInfo` and `Unity.AppUI.UI.Chip.clickedWithEventInfo` events.
- Added `trailing-icon` property in `ActionButton` component.
- Added `damping-effect-duration` property in Canvas element. The default value is 750ms.

- Added `ResizeHandle` component. This special component can be added to your layout to resize a given `target` when dragging it. This component is currently used in the new resizable `Popover` element.
- Added `resizable` and `resizableDirection` properties in `Popover` class. You are now able to resize a `Popover` using the bottom-right corner of the popover pane. A resizable Popover will not be repositionned.

- Added `INavigationScreen` interface, more extensible than the base class `NavigationScreen`.
- Added `leadingContainer` and `leadingContentTemplate` properties to the `AccordionItem` element.

This can be useful when coupled to Dependency Injection so you can retreive instances of your screens from a `IServiceProvider`. By default, the property is set with the use of `System.Activator.CreateInstance`.
